# Security Policy

We take security seriously, and we strive to keep our software as secure as possible.    
That being said, nothing is ever 100% secure, if you've found a potential security issue we'd love to know about it.

### Reporting security issues

If you've found a security issue and wish to discuss it with the team directly, please email us at `software@sberg.net`.    
We'll determine a course of action from that point onward, and we'll strive to keep you updated.

If you feel like the issue is too minor for email, feel free to open an issue instead.

### Supported versions

Currently we're interested in issues for the current major release, code in the `main` branch, or code in any active development branch.
